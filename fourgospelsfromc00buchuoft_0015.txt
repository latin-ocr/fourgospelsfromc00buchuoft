JA'TRODCCTJOX vii

With reference to the Capitula, found in our MS„ but wanting in most old Latin MSS„
there is good reason to believe that they did not sorm part of the archetype from which the text
of ff was copied, but were gathered from another MS. which had affinities with the parent of the
DPGQ aur c group, whose Capitula are given by Wordsworth and White in their edition of the
Vulgate Gospels ¹.

As regards the paragraphs in ffi they exhibit a curious correspondence with those in e. It
rnay be roughly stated that five out of every six breaks in the narrative in e are also found in ff
The paragraphs in b andffin St. John are almost identical.

The result of the comparison of the palaeography of ff with that of other ancient Latin MSS.
has convinced the present writer that ff must rank with a in point of antiquity. It is earlier than
hac& or n, and also earlier than b. Many of the letters in ff resemble the uncial letters current in
the fourth century. The M in ff is a replica of the M of the fourth century Cicero Palimpsest at
Rome, Pal. Soc. ii. Pl. 160.

One cannot tabulate all the palaeographical impressions that are received from a MS. and
that lead to the belief that it is earlier or later than another. The great simplicity of the letters in ff,
the absence of all knobs or ornamental points, the smallness and plaz'nness of the capitals‚ the
straightness and thinness of lines marking abbreviations, the extreme rarity of punctuation a-all
these contribute to the conviction that ff belongs to a remote antiquity, and that it surpasses in
age all other Old Latin MSS. with the exception of (ι.

Clzaracler of llze Codex.

The study of a MS. involves a twofold mental process—the ascertaining of the character
of the scribe's exemplar and at the same time the ascertaining of the character of the scribe
himself.

The licence of Western scribes is almost proverbial, and has been used by Hort as a strong
argument for dismissing as summarily as he has done the evidence of Western MSS. When
a MS. such as e writes, for example, capharnaum for naim, and capharnaum also for corozain,
confounds Cleophas and Cephas and alters the context accordingly, the student may well hesitate
about accepting any singular readings of such a codex. A witness who distorts even a few facts
impairs the value of his evidence as a whole.

The striking character of ff is the absence of any such errors as those just named. There
are unconscious errors of transcription such as are found in all MSS. ; but of wilful alteration of
the text from ‘supposed fitness for immediate and obvious edification ’ there is, to the best of the
present writer’s belief, not a single instance.

The singular readings of ff are quite different in character from most of the singular readings
of e, or even of b or k.

Another source of obliteration of ancient readings is the Harmonistic proclivity of many
scribes—the result of such compilations as Ephrem‘s Dz'czlessczron. Again, ff can be shown to
be more free from this influence than any extant Latin or Greek MS.
