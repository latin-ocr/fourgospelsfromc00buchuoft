viii JNIJ? ODC'C NON

Summmy.
Evidence for assigning ff to as early a date as 37 5—42 5 may be discovered in

(a) The unfixedness of the spelling to a degree unparalleled in any other MS. Of this
almost every page of the MS. furnishes proof.

(β) The exceeding rarity of punctuation.

(γ) The absence of all observance of the rules of grammar3 and the persistence ot
vulgarisms in both grammar and spelling.

(δ) The shape and form of the letters, especially of E, T, M and O.

(ε) The large amount of verbal variation from the Vulgata especially in such well-known
and often quoted verses as St. Matt. xi. 28, St. Luke ii. 14, St. Mark xiv. 24.

(ζ) The comparative freedom of ff from the harmonizings which are found in other texts.
The earliest texts would be the least harmonized. [Cf. St. Matt. xxiv. 35, xxvii. 34 3 St. Luke
iii. 21, vi. 31 3 St. Mark iv, 39, xiv. 24.]

(θ) The agreement of ff with the Old Syriae Version 3 and with Irenaeus and Origen in
ancient readings lost in all other MSS.

The cumulative force of the evidence from these sources cannot be negatived by imputing
to ff ‘the textual timidity of the fifth century '. That the text of ff keeps on the whole nearer
to the Text. Recept. than do the other ancient Old Latin MSS. (with the exception of α) is
a fact which must be recognized, but it determines nothing either for or against the antiquity of
our MS. or of its text. In this case, as in others, theories must be subserviated to ascertained
facts. The large measure of support given by the two oldest Latin MSS. a and ff to the Text.
Recept. is a fact which can no longer be neglected, especially when it is remembered that ‘the
text has been preserved with less alteration in the versions than in the MSS?

The reader is referred for a full discussion of this evidence to the writer's articles in the
Journal (gf T heologz'cal Sludz'es for October, 1905, and January, 1906.

The text that follows is an exact print, line for line and column for column, of the whole
MS. Where italic type occurs, it always, except in the headings of the pages, denotes rubricated
letters in the original. All corrections in the MS. carlser than the lwelfllz censeas-y have been faith-
fully given either in the text or in the Appendix at the end of the volume. The copious later
Vulgate corrections have (for the most part) been omitted.

Posfscrzpt. My warmest thanks are due to the Rev. H. J. white, who, among other
services, has revised the printed sheets of ff with the MS. itself, and has thus conferred on
the present edition a high degree of accuracy.

Ι have also to thank my learned friends, ΜΓ. Α. Souter and the Rev. J. F. Bethune-Baker,
and my obligations to Professor Burkitt, of Cambridge, and Dr. Sanday, of Oxsord, are too
many to be here set out in detail. From M. Henri Omont and the other authorities at the
Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris Ι have received nothing but courtesy during the past eight
years in which Ι have been a frequent visitor at their magnificent Library of MSS.
