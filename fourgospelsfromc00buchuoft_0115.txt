FRAGMENTS OF THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES:

(1 St. Peter iv. 17-2 St. Peter ii. 7. 1 St. John i. 8-iii. 20)

ALSO FRAGMENTS OF THE APOCALYPSE AND OF THE
ACTS FROM THE FLEURY PALIMPSEST (h)

MONITUM.

THESE precious Palimpsest Fragments of the Catholic Epistles are now preserved in the
Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris, where they form four leaves (Fon. 122, 123, 128 and 129) of
a large volume numbered 6400 G. Together with fourteen other leaves-ten of the Acts and sour
of the Apocalypse—they represent all that survives of 3 MS. that contained an Old Latin form of
text, and is now known as h. The fragments extend in all from Fol. 113 to Fol. 130.

Sabatier copied out three of the easiest pageS, and published them in 1743 in his Bz'bl. Sacr.
ἰαί. Vers. Ant„ tom. iii, p. 507 ff.

A. Vansittart of Cambridge published some further portions in the Journal of th'lology in
1869 and 1872. Ι

Η. Omont gave the text of four pages of the Apocalypse in the Bz'bliollthue de l’Ecole des
Charles in 1883.

J. Belsheim in 1887 published about two-thirds of the MS. in an edition which would have
been more accurate had he consulted the readings given by other scholars before him.

Finally Berger in 1889 (Le Palz'mpsesle de Flemy. Paris. Fishbacher) issued a wellnigh
complete edition of the„ whole eighteen leaves. Berger’s edition is a monument of patient and
accurate research. Ι gladly acknowledge that I have been but a gleaner in a field from which he
has gathered the harvest. To complete Berger’s work and to leave no point unresolved, Ι have
spent two whole years in ascertaining and verifying the small part of the text—about one-fiftieth
of the whole—that he left unascertained or doubtful. Many pages will be found to be practically
a reprint of his edition. These have been added from a wish to provide those who do not
possess Berger's work with a complete edition of the Palimpsest.

In the present edition of the four leaves of the MS. that contain the Fragments of the
Catholic Epistles,I owe much to the excellence of the photographs taken forme by MM. Berthaud
Freres. Ι am deeply indebted to Mr. Valentine Richards who lent me Berger's photographs.

The Fragments appear to have been written in the fifth century. Subsequently three
correctors at different periods corrected the text, which was finally washed and scraped with pumice
in the late seventh or early eighth century to receive part of the De Mundo of St. Isidore.

The text of the Catholic Epistles preserved in lz is unique among extant Latin MSS„ and as
such is worthy of the patience required to decipher the more difficult pages of the MS.

The ligatures Ι have noted are unc, unt, τια, ur, us, ul, ae, re, ns, and nt.

There are corrections in the MS. by three different hands.
The diorthota corrects in small square uncials of great beauty. He changes many a b to u.
ha much resembles in writing the original scribe, and is of the same century. The Vulgate
is unknown to him.
lzb, a most prolific corrector, inserts on Fol. 1 28 alone forty-three corrections, all of which are
Vulgate readings. His corrections, except in a few instances, have been neglected. He is of the
