consisting of five separate leaves, but which may have once been a ternion. The quires of the
MS. were as follows: i—iii (lost), iv-xiii‚ xiv (1 and 8 lost), xxx-xviii, xix (4, 5, and 7 lost), xx-xxviii.

About two centuries ago (so it appears) the extant leaves were numbered throughout, but
carelessly enough, inasmuch as two consecutive leaves are both numbered 55 and two other
consecutive leaves are marked 88. The last leaf is numbered 190, and the Codex therefore,
in its present form, contains neither 190 nor 191, as has been previously stated, but 192 leaves.

Twenty-three signatures are found at the foot of the inner margin of the verso side of
leaves numbered 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 55 bis, 63, 71, 79, 92, 100, 108, 116, 121, 129, 137,
145, 153, 161, 169, 177, and 185. The leaf that followed 85 and was signed xiiii is lost.

In addition to the mode of numbering by quaternions signed at the 1001 01 1116 page there
survives a trace of another niethod of counting by binions. On sol. 48 verso under the title is
written the letter R by the same hand that wrote the signature uiiii below. Now this R stood
originally on the seventy-second leaf of the MS„ and 4 >< 18 = 72.

The vellum is exceedingly fine, so much so that when photographed the letters on the other
side appear through the vellum. Looking at a photo 01 fol. 48 verso one might easily read ade-<pit
in St. John iii. 32 for adripit owing to part of the letter m of homo being visible through the vellum.

Some pages of the lNlS.-—notably fol. 49 verso—are as clear to-day as when they 1611 1116
hand of the copyist fifteen centuries ago3 but others are faded and only fully decipherable
by observant study of the MS. as a whole.

There are two columns of twenty—four lines on each page. Every page before being
written on has been accurately ruled with twenty-four horizonta} lines and four vertical lines.
To guide the horizonta] ruling a vertical line of twenty-four prickings was first made, extending
down the page and about three inches from the right-hand edge of the vellum.

Each vellum leaf measures 28·5 cm. by 245 cm„ or 11} in. by 9} in. (approximately the
measurement of e); but originally was soniewhat larger, having been clipped in the process of
binding.

The leaves are now bound in a binding not more than 200 years old, and uniform with
that of other manuscript books in the Library.

The compendia are only those found in the most ancient MSS„ and some are peculiar tofi:—
