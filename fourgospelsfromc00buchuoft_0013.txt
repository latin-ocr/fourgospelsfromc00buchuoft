INTRODUCTION

THE CODEX CORBEIENSIS

A mum? description of the Codex, together with an imperfect collation (in St. John, St. Luke.
and St. Mark only), is given by Bianchini in his Evangelc'arz'um Quadruplex, which appeared
in 1749. The select readings given by Bianchini are, however, far from accurate.

Sabatier also gave variant readings (rather less accurately than Bianchini) in the third
volume of his great work Bl'ble'orum Sacr. Lassnae Is'ersiones Amsquae seu Vesus Italica, corn-
pleted in 1749. How inaccurate the quotations of Bianchini and Sabatier are may be gathered
srom the fact that Tischendorf's citations in his Ed. viii maior, which are taken from their
work, contain in St. John's Gospel alone not fewer than 153 false readings.

In more recent times the Norwegian scholar Belsheim has published an edition of the
text (without the Capitula or the Prologue to St. Luke), Christiania, 1887. In Belsheim's work
there is no attempt to render the Codex line for line and page for page. The editor tells us
that he noted in a copy of the Vulgate the variant readings he saw in the MS„ and printed his
edition from this annotated copy. The result has been to give the Codex the appearance of
having a Vulgate base in many passages where no such Vulgate base exists.

Finally‚ the learned English editors of the Vulgate give a very full collation of the MSS. in
St. Luke and St. John. (In St. Matthew and St. Mark they seem to 1·er solely on Tischendorf's
citations‚ which are not always accurate.) This collation is the outcome of the critical sagacity
of the late Samuel Berger, whose work in deciphering old Latin MSS. (notably Le Palimpsesle
de Fleury) entitles him to the gratitude of all students of the Latin text of the New Testament.

The early history of the MS. is involved in utter obscurity. The copyist left no record
of his name or environment. His work shows him unacquainted with the Latin language. ⁵

The MS. belonged anciently to the Benedictine Monastery of Corbey near Amiens—once
the home of many precious records of the early Christian ages ¹. It entered in comparatively
recent times into the Bibliotheque Royale, whose red stamp it bears on its last page. It has now
found a home in the Bibliotheque Nationale‚ where it is numbered Lat. 17,225.

The Codex has lost three out of eight quires in St. Matthew. The first three quires have
perished down to xi. 16 (not xi. 6 as Belsheirn says). The first leaves of ancient MSS. seem most
exposed to loss: e has lost its first five quires. Two leaves are missing from St. John containing
xvii. 15—xviii. 9 and xx. 23-xxi. 8 respectively. Three leaves are wanting in St. Luke; two of
these were consecutive and contained ix. 45-x. 203 the third contained xi. 45—xii. 6. Happily
St. Mark is complete except that three leaves—the last two and the third of Quire xxvi—are
mutilated. The first two extant leaves of St. Matthew are also slightly mutilated 2.

The Codex originally consisted of twenty-seven gatherings of eight, and a gathering now

² The verses lost through this mutilation are St. Matt. xi. 20; xii. 3 3 St. Mark ix. 19, 23, 24, 28, and in part
13, 20, 29, 31, 33; xvi. 17 rexcept three letters). and in part 16, 18, 20.
