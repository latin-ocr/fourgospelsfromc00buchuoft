98 PALIMPSESTUS FLORIA CENSJS

late sixth or early seventh century. The work of the corrector is sometimes a clue to the reading
of the first hand: viz., the discovery of adulescentes in the large letters of hb above the line in
1 St. Peter v, 5 led to the search for and discovery of the reading underneath—el uos minores natu.

The Fragments contain twenty-three lines on a page,1 and are headed EPISTOLA PETRI PRIMA
(uel SECUNDA), and EPISTOLA roHANNIS PRIMA. The titles are in uncials which are only slightly
larger than the average size of those used in the text. The size of individual letters varies
considerably in different lines in the MS. Sometimes the scribe contracts and sometimes he
expands the size and interspaces of his letters. On the same page he will write fifty letters in one
line and but forty in a subsequent line, his usual number being about forty-eight‚ of which forty
on an average now survive. A remarkable unfixedness in the spelling of proper names is notice-
able in the Acts, where Paulus is variously spelt paulus, laulus, pctus, and even populu53 whilst
Illoses appears as moyses, menses and mosses. A similar unfixedness of spelling occurs in ff The
form anim, which regularly replaces enim in the Epistles of St. Peter, is a peculiarity of h that
also deserves attention. Of the punctuation that Ι have discovered not more than five (or six)
points, if we except numerals, can be ascribed to 72³²: the rest is due to ἢῆ and bb.

AFTER revising the Catholic Epistles Ι set myself to decipher the few lines in the Apocalypse
and Acts which that eminent scholar the late Samuel Berger had not fully deciphered. Berger
accomplished more than any other one man could have done; but he himself did not regard his
work as final. By persistent study I have been able to discover some new readings.

Many pages in the MS. must be read upside down in respect of the superposed writing.² In
the few instances where Ι differ from Berger it is only after a thrice-repeated examination both of
the MS. and of photographs that I secured in Paris of the more difficult pages. Ι was happy
enough in the end to decipher every word undeciphered by Berger. In Acts xiv. 6 the inter-
polation sicul ihs dzssrerat ez's LX[XH] is, I believe, peculiar to hacts· It is doubly interesting
because St. Luke is the only one who mentions the LXX [LXXII] in his Gospel. It is almost
certain, from considerations of space, that our MS. read LXXII and not LXX. The use of
fidell‘las z πίστις (iii 16) and languidus -—. ἀδύνατος (XlV. 7) lS alSO nOteWOI‘thy. The WOrdS Of
St. Paul in xiv. 9, lz'bz' dico in nomine ihu noslrz‘ dfn' fili dei, are also read in this form only by h,
though both d and e have a somewhat similar text, but omit fili dez'.

The heading of the Acts is : Acris APOSTOLORUM SANTORL'M (sic). Similarly santorum occurs
for sanctorum in iii. 21. The Apocalypse has the title: APOCALYPSIS IonAxms APOSTOLI.

There is a striking resemblance in the Acts between these fragments and the Latin Irenaeus.

The correctors who corrected the Catholic Epistles corrected also the Acts and the
Apocalypse. hb constantly corrects to the norm of the Vulgate. In Acts iii. 13 a new corrector
020), later than hb, added high above the line an s to lradidzlrlz'.

The copyist of the De illundo clipped away as a rule three inches from one side of each leaf
before using it.⁸ Had he clipped equally from both sides, but few (if any) letters would have
perished. As it is, the average loss from each line is about eight letters. In addition the lines
found at the foot of a few of the pages, as in the case of Folios 120 and 127, have lost some
additional letters owing to the vellum having become slightly worn on the right-hand margin.
Missing letters have in every case been restored in brackets. Inasmuch as the vellum is normally
shorn vertically‚ it is possible to make this restoration with great precision at the beginning of
a line,‘¹ by calculating from the space of known missing letters the space that must have been

¹ One page of the Acts (Fol. 125* by an error contains only twenty-two lines in Berger's edition.

² Ι have placed the Folio numbers of such pages on the lcfl hand above the text—in the MS. they are on the
lest hand below the text and inverted.

³ The vellum having text on both sides, the elipping away of the first letters of the lines on one side of a leaf
would luvolve the loss of the last letters of the lines on the other side and vice versa.

4 It is obvious from the fact that at the end of a line the scribe not infrequently writes two or three letters in
the margin, or in ligature, that such precision is only attainable at the beginning of a line.
